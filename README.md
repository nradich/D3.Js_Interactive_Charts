# D3.Js_Interactive_Charts

This project utilizes D3.js to create a scatter plot with bubble labels and an active tooltip to provide more exact details
about each bubble.

The code to generate the chart can be found in the StarterCode directory under js in the app.js file. Please ignore yaxis.js. That file
was created in hopes of creating a more advanced chart with more funcionality.

The data.csv file is in the js folder because I was having issues with the path to initial location of the data.

The files can be run on a local machine by initializing a local server.
